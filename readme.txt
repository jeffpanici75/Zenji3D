About
-----
Zenji 3D is a remake of the 1980's classic Zenji, created by
Matthew Hubbard and published by Activision.  Originally
developed for the Atari 400, Zenji was eventually ported to
every popular home system of that era.

Even for the 1980's, Zenji broke new ground and represented
a unique and enduring form of gameplay.  My desire in 
remaking Zenji is not to just bring an old game to new 
platforms, but to rather bring a form of gameplay to the
current market that is sorely missing.

Zenji 3D isn't just a "face lift" of the original.  It
contains improvements and variations that we feel move
the gameplay to the next level.

I hope you enjoy Zenji 3D.  Good luck and have fun!

System Requirements
---------------------------
PII350 w/128MB RAM and at least 10MB of free disk space
GeForce 2/Radeon 7200 or better

Zenji 3D is primarily dependent upon good 3D video hardware for optimum performance.  
The game was developed on a Radeon 7200 and tested on:

Voodoo Banshee (limited support)
Voodoo 3500 (limited support) 
Voodoo 5500
ATI Rage 128
ATI Radeon 7200
GeForce 3
GeForce 4

The 3Dfx boards do not properly support Zenji 3D and more modern and supported hardware is
recommended.  If you do use a 3Dfx board, consider upgrading the BIOS and drivers.  You can

Command Line Switches
---------------------
Zenji 3D supports a number of command line switches.  Here is a list:

Switch     Description 
------     -----------         
-fps       Turn on the rendered triangle counter and frames-per-second counter.
-resw val  Define the resolution width, e.g. 640 or 800.
-resh val  Define the resolution height, e.g. 480 or 600.
-resd val  Define the resolution depth, e.g. 8, 16, or 32.

Note that the -res{x} val switches are combined together to define a *valid* 
resolution for your video hardware. If the values specified don't form a valid
combination then the start mode selection path is used.
